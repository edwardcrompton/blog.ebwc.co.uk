Why do we refer to Y Wyddfa (Snowdon) as the highest mountain in England and Wales? Why not refer to it as the highest mountain in Belgium, Denmark and Wales?

And why, when listing the countries that Y Wyddfa is the "the highest mountain in", do we start with a country that Y Wyddfa is not in?

When talking about Lake Hornindalsvatnet, Norway and Europe's deepest lake, do we, for example refer to it as the deepest lake in France, Italy and Norway? No we don't, because that would sound ridiculous and it wouldn't make any sense.

So I'm going to start refering to Y Wyddfa as the highest mountain in Wales. i no longer feel the need to list any other countries whose mountains it also happens to be higher than.
